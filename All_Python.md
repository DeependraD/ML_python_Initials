## Programming in Python

Here, I have tried to compile a make-believe rich content with multiple links to materials that are likely to bolster my python skills.

1. This link is pretty helpful identifying the topics that you'll basically ever need to learn in scientific python computing:
  http://www.scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/115969/289057/

2. This is another one from scipy2016:
  https://scipy2016.scipy.org/ehome/146062/332960/

3. Conference talk on scipy available from youtube: [Jupyter Advanced Topics Tutorial by Jonathan Frederic, Matthias Bussonier...]
  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38R7jiCspkw)

4. This one down here provides an online interface to sympy programming, Try it for instant gratifications since you don't need to install any libraries everything will be loaded on call.

5. This is pretty interesting numpy tutorial:
